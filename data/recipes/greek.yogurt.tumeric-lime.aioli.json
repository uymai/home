  "ingredients": [
    "1/2 cup plain 0% Greek yogurt",
    "1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil",
    "1 tsp ground turmeric",
    "1 small garlic clove, finely grated or pressed",
    "1 1/2 tbsp lime juice (≈1/2 lime or bottled)",
    "1/2 tsp maple syrup",
    "1/2 tsp Dijon mustard (optional)",
    "1/4 tsp ground cumin or coriander (optional, for a Middle Eastern note)",
    "1/4 tsp salt, or to taste",
    "Pinch black pepper or cayenne (optional)"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a small pan over low heat, warm the olive oil. Stir in turmeric and garlic for about 30 seconds, just until fragrant. Remove from heat.",
    "In a medium bowl, whisk together the yogurt, lime juice, maple syrup, Dijon, salt, and cumin or coriander if using.",
    "Slowly whisk in the warm turmeric-garlic oil until smooth and evenly colored.",
    "Taste and adjust seasoning: add a touch more lime for brightness or a few drops of maple syrup if it’s too tangy.",
    "Chill for at least 30 minutes before serving to let flavors meld and the sauce thicken slightly."

  "notes": "Serve cool over grilled chicken breast or shish taouk skewers. Excellent as a dip for sweet potatoes, a dressing for kale or arugula salads, or a spread for wraps. Keeps 4–5 days in the fridge. For extra creaminess, blend briefly with an immersion blender before chilling."
