  "ingredients": [
    "1 small green cabbage, thinly sliced (about 6–7 cups)",
    "1 teaspoon olive oil (or canola)",
    "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt",
    "1 tablespoon lemon juice (instead of 1/2 lemon)",
    "1 teaspoon maple syrup",
    "Optional: pinch red pepper flakes",
    "Optional: 1/4 teaspoon sesame oil for aroma"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.",
    "Add the sliced cabbage and kosher salt. Sauté for 6–8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the cabbage softens and some edges begin to brown.",
    "Reduce heat to medium-low. Add the lemon juice and maple syrup, stirring to coat the cabbage evenly.",
    "Taste and adjust seasoning. Add red pepper flakes or sesame oil if desired.",
    "Cook 1 additional minute until glossy and lightly caramelized. Serve warm."

  "notes": "For a burger topping version, cook only 3–4 minutes to keep the cabbage crisper. Use sesame oil sparingly—it goes a long way. Green cabbage is preferred here; red cabbage stays too firm and gets earthy with rosemary."
