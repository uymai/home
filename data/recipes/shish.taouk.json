    "3 tbsp olive oil",
    "3 tbsp lemon juice (juice of 1 lemon)",

    "1 ½ tsp paprika",

    "1 tsp salt",
    "½ tsp black pepper",
    "½ tsp ground cinnamon or allspice (optional, gives it a 'Lebanese' edge)"

  "notes": "The longer you marinate, the more flavorful the chicken will be. Overnight marinating is ideal. You can use either chicken thighs (more tender) or breast (leaner). Soak wooden skewers in water for 30 minutes before using to prevent burning."
