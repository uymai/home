  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "tags": ["sauce", "garlic", "lebanese", "dip", "quick", "mayo", "gluten-free"],
  "ingredients": [
    "½ cup mayonnaise (full-fat works best — Greek yogurt can work too, but it's tangier)",
    "2 garlic cloves, finely grated or crushed into paste (microplane works best)",
    "1 tbsp lemon juice (fresh squeezed)",
    "1 tbsp olive oil",
    "Pinch of salt"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a small bowl, whisk together mayo, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, and salt.",

    "Chill until serving (flavour deepens after 15–20 minutes)."
  ],
  "notes": "Makes about ½ cup. For best flavor, let it sit for 15-20 minutes before serving to allow the garlic flavor to develop."
