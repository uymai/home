  "description": "Crispy torn tofu seasoned like your usual baked chicken (salt and pepper) with a light cornstarch coating so it holds up well in soups seasoned with oregano and basil.",
  "prepTime": "10 minutes (plus optional freezing/thawing)",
  "cookTime": "12-15 minutes",
  "servings": 2,
  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "tags": ["tofu", "air fryer", "soup topping", "high protein", "vegetarian"],
  "ingredients": [
    "1 block extra-firm tofu (pressed; freezing/thawing optional)",
    "1–2 tsp canola oil or extra virgin olive oil",
    "1–1.5 tsp cornstarch",
    "1/2 tsp salt",
    "1/4 tsp black pepper",
    "1/4 tsp garlic powder",
    "1/4 tsp onion powder",
    "1/4 tsp dried oregano",
    "1/4 tsp dried basil (optional)"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "If using the freeze method, freeze tofu in or out of the package. Thaw completely, drain, and press for 10–15 minutes.",
    "Tear tofu into bite-sized pieces instead of cubing. Irregular edges get crispier and give a chicken-like texture.",
    "In a bowl, toss tofu pieces with oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, and basil.",
    "Sprinkle cornstarch over the seasoned tofu and toss again until lightly coated. The coating should look dry, not pasty.",
    "Preheat air fryer to 400°F (200°C).",
    "Air fry tofu for 12–15 minutes, shaking halfway, until edges are golden and crisp.",
    "Add to soup bowls right before serving so the exterior stays crisp."
  ],
  "notes": "Cornstarch helps the tofu stay crisp even after sitting in broth for a few minutes. If you want maximum crisp, use the freezing/thawing method for better texture absorption."
