  "tags": ["coleslaw", "high-protein", "vegetarian", "meal-prep", "macro-friendly"],
  "ingredients": [
    "1/2 head green cabbage, finely chopped",
    "1–2 carrots, grated (optional)",
    "1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt (0–2%)",
    "1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil",
    "1 tbsp apple cider vinegar (or white vinegar)",
    "1–2 tsp maple syrup (to taste)",
    "1/2 tsp salt",
    "Black pepper, to taste",
    "1/2 tsp Dijon mustard (optional)",
    "1/4 tsp garlic powder or celery seed (optional)"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Place chopped cabbage in a large bowl and toss with a small pinch of the salt. Let sit for 5–10 minutes to draw out moisture.",
    "In a separate bowl, whisk together Greek yogurt, olive oil, vinegar, maple syrup, remaining salt, black pepper, and any optional seasonings.",
    "Add cabbage (and carrots if using) to the dressing and toss until evenly coated.",
    "Taste and adjust seasoning — add more maple for sweetness or vinegar for tang.",
    "Refrigerate for 10–20 minutes before serving for best texture and flavor."
  ],
  "notes": "Salting the cabbage first prevents watery slaw. This keeps well for 2–3 days in the fridge. For a spicy version, add hot sauce or sriracha to the dressing."
