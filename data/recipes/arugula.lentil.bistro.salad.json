  "ingredients": [
    "1 cup dry French green lentils (or Unico brown lentils)",
    "1 bay leaf (optional, for flavor)",
    "4–5 cups arugula (a big handful per serving)",
    "1 medium apple, thinly sliced or cubed",
    "½ cup walnuts, toasted (or pecans)",
    "⅓ cup goat cheese or blue cheese crumbles",
    "3 tbsp olive oil",
    "1½ tbsp balsamic vinegar",
    "1 tsp Dijon mustard",
    "1 tsp honey (optional but nice with apple)",
    "Pinch of salt & black pepper"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Cook lentils: If using dry French lentils, simmer in salted water with bay leaf ~20–25 min until just tender. If using Unico brown lentils (dry), simmer ~18–20 min, check early so they don't get mushy. If using canned Unico lentils, just drain & rinse. Drain and cool slightly.",
    "Make dressing: In a small jar or bowl, whisk olive oil, balsamic, Dijon, honey, salt, and pepper until emulsified.",
    "Assemble salad: Add arugula to a large bowl. Toss in warm (or room temp) lentils, apple slices, and walnuts.",
    "Drizzle dressing and toss gently.",
    "Sprinkle goat cheese/blue cheese on top just before serving."
  ],
  "notes": "Eat immediately, or keep components separate for meal prep (lentils & dressing hold well for 4 days, arugula/cheese/apple add fresh)."
