  "notes": "This dressing is perfect for Asian-inspired salads, grain bowls, or as a dipping sauce. Adjust sriracha to your heat preference - start with 1 tbsp and add more if you want it spicier. The vegan yogurt version works great for plant-based diets. Water helps thin it to a pourable consistency."
