    "120 ml low-sodium chicken stock",
    "120 g 0% Greek yogurt (for filling)",
    "30 g light cream cheese",
    "45 g reduced-sugar ketchup",
    "60 g diced pickles",
    "1 tsp Worcestershire sauce or soy sauce",

  "instructions": [
    "Preheat oven to 400°F (205°C) and line a baking tray with parchment paper.",
    "Lightly coat a pan with cooking spray and cook the ground turkey over medium heat, breaking it up as it cooks.",
    "Add diced onion, garlic powder, smoked paprika, cayenne (if using), salt, and pepper. Cook until onion is soft and turkey is just cooked through.",
    "Pour in chicken stock and simmer for 2–3 minutes until mostly reduced.",
    "Lower heat and stir in Greek yogurt, cream cheese, ketchup, pickles, and Worcestershire or soy sauce. Mix until creamy. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.",
    "In a large bowl, mix flour, vital wheat gluten, and salt. Add Greek yogurt and stir until a dough forms.",
    "Knead dough briefly until smooth, then rest for 5–10 minutes.",
    "Divide dough into 8 equal portions. Roll each into a thin oval.",
    "Divide filling evenly among dough portions. Fold dough over filling and seal edges tightly.",
    "Place hot pockets seam-side down on prepared tray. Lightly spray tops with cooking spray.",
    "Bake for 18–22 minutes until golden and firm.",
    "Cool slightly before serving."

  "notes": "Vital wheat gluten is the main protein booster here and keeps the dough chewy and sturdy. If unavailable, the recipe still works with all flour but with lower protein. These reheat well: Microwave for 1-2 minutes on high, then airfry for 4 minutes at 380F. Pair with air-fried sweet potatoes and a kale salad to round out fiber and micronutrients."
