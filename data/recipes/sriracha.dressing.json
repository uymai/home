  "ingredients": [
    "3 tbsp plain Greek yogurt (or 2 tbsp mayo if you want richer)",
    "1 tbsp olive oil or avocado oil",
    "1–1 ½ tbsp sriracha (adjust heat)",
    "1 tsp honey or maple syrup (balances the spice, optional if you want less sugar)",
    "1 tsp rice vinegar (or apple cider vinegar)",
    "Juice of ½ lemon (≈ 1 ½ tbsp bottled lemon juice if that's what you've got)",
    "Pinch of garlic powder and salt"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Add all ingredients to a small bowl or jar.",
    "Whisk until smooth and creamy.",
    "Add a splash of water to thin if needed for drizzling.",
    "Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.",
    "Store in refrigerator for up to 1 week."

  "notes": "Makes about ½ cup. For a vegan version, use maple syrup instead of honey and ensure your sriracha is vegan. The dressing will thicken in the fridge, so you may need to add a little water when serving."
